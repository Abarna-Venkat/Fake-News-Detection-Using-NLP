# Fake-News-Detection-Using-NLP
This project uses Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to detect fake news by analyzing textual content. It classifies news as real or fake using models like Logistic Regression or LSTM, helping to combat misinformation in digital media.

# Deep Report:
In the age of digital media, the rapid spread of misinformation and fake news poses serious challenges to society, affecting public opinion, trust, and decision-making. This project aims to develop a Fake News Detection System using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to automatically classify news articles as real or fake.

By analyzing the textual content of news articles—such as headlines, body text, and metadata—the model learns linguistic patterns and key indicators often associated with deceptive content. We use techniques such as TF-IDF, Bag of Words, and word embeddings for feature extraction, followed by classification using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, or LSTM neural networks.

The system is trained on a labeled dataset of real and fake news, allowing it to generalize well to new, unseen articles. The final goal is to build a web-based interface where users can input a news article or headline and receive an instant credibility score or classification result.
